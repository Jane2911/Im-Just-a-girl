# 🎀I'm Just a girl🎀
A project co-made by me and @Rosshana-raj for the CS Girlies Beginner-friendly Hackathon. Given 48 hours to create something unmistakably human, unhinged and soulful, the idea of girlhood and the online phrase of "I'm Just a girl" evoked a beautiful and chaotic start of a Ren'Py day of a life of a girl✨
